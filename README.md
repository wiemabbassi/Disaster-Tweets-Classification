This project uses BERT (bert-large-uncased) for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify disaster-related tweets. The model processes tweets and predicts whether they are about a real disaster or not. This is achieved by fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model on the "Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets" dataset(from Kaggle).

Key Steps:
Preprocess the text data (tokenization, removing special characters, emails, and HTML tags).
Fine-tune BERT for text classification.
Train the model and make predictions.

Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of:

A pre-trained bert-large-uncased model from Hugging Face.
Custom BERT layer integrated into a Keras sequential model.
Dense layers for classification, with a final output layer using sigmoid activation for binary classification.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to classify tweets as either disaster-related (1) or not (0). We use the BERT transformer model, fine-tuned on the dataset to achieve this classification task.

Key Steps:
Preprocess the text data (tokenization, removing special characters, emails, and HTML tags).
Fine-tune BERT for text classification.
Train the model and make predictions.
Submit the predicted results.
Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of:

A pre-trained bert-large-uncased model from Hugging Face.
Custom BERT layer integrated into a Keras sequential model.
Dense layers for classification, with a final output layer using sigmoid activation for binary classification.
The model is trained using binary cross-entropy loss and optimized using Adam optimizer.

Data Preprocessing
We preprocess the text data by applying the following steps:

Convert text to lowercase.
Remove emails, HTML tags, special characters, and accented characters.
Tokenize the text using the bert-large-uncased tokenizer, ensuring all sequences have a maximum length of 36 tokens.
Generate attention masks to handle padding effectively.
The preprocessing is done using the Hugging Face tokenizer, which returns the input IDs and attention masks.

Training
The model is compiled and trained with the following settings:

Optimizer: Adam with a learning rate of 1e-5.
Loss function: Binary cross-entropy.
Metrics: Accuracy.
Batch size: 10.
Epochs: 10. 

Prediction
Once the model is trained, we tokenize and preprocess the test data in the same way. Predictions are made using the fine-tuned BERT model, and the results are saved in the required format for submission.
